# CaseAssist 🧑‍⚖️💬

**CaseAssist** is a simple lawyer consultancy website. People who have legal problems can submit their complaints on the website. A lawyer can view the complaint, accept it, and solve the issue. The user and the lawyer can talk to each other using a chat feature. 

Both user and lawyer have their own login and dashboard. The only shared feature between them is the chat interface.
